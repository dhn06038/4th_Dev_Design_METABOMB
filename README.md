### Advantages of the Performance Industry X Metaverse
- Participate in the festival without restrictions of time and space.
  
- Greater immersion as the spatial environment itself changes.
  
- Enjoy the performance more with various interaction features in the VR environment.


#
### Background
Citizens work like machines in the bleak Meta-City, where music is forbidden. Their only joy is secretly listening to music.

Then, a giant BOMB suddenly appears in the sky over Meta-City. This is the only guerrilla event in the city where you can enjoy a concert.

To get a ticket, they shoot at the giant bomb using weapon-shaped instruments.

Finally, the bomb explodes, and they enter the bomb, where an artist and a frenzied music festival are taking place.
